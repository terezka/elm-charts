# Elm Plot

Plot stuff in SVG with Elm!


## Overview

Currently, this library can draw scatter, line, bar and area-series, grids, hints, and as many axes as you could wish for with easily configurable ticks and labels. I'm still working on catching up with common features of the plotting libraries already around, and the API might change, so please bear with me!

### What does the api look like?

Something like this:

```elm
    main =
		plot
			[ size plotSize
			, margin ( 10, 20, 40, 20 )
			]
			[ line
			    [ Line.stroke pinkStroke
			    , Line.strokeWidth 2
			    ]
			    data
			, xAxis
			    [ Axis.line [ Line.stroke axisColor ]
			    , Axis.tick [ Tick.viewDynamic toTickStyle ]
			    , Axis.label [ Label.viewDynamic toLabelStyle ]
			    ]
			]
```

You're welcome to take a look at the docs folder for many more [examples](https://github.com/terezka/elm-plot/tree/master/docs)!
